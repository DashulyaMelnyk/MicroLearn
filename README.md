# MicroLearn :thought_balloon: 	:bomb:

MicroLearn is a mobile application for "microlearning", which sends the user one page a day (a portion of material that does not exceed a certain amount and has a complete opinion) on the topic he wants to study. Moreover, the user can choose either our proposed topic, or invite your own. This could be a random page from Wikipedia, the CIA World Factbook, documentation, or elsewhere.
Where “Microlearning” is a well-established term, which is learning a small amount of material in a short period of time. The term is most often used in electronic learning formats. Microlearning as an approach is the concept of absorbing any knowledge in small units.
